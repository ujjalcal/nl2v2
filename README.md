| **UI Interaction**   | View-only; updates passively reflect execution                     |

---

## üß† Core Concepts

### 1. **Goal Template System**

* Each repeatable workflow (e.g., Data-to-DB, NL Query-to-Answer) is defined as a **goal template**
* The **Master Agent** instantiates a goal with substeps

```json
{
  "goal_id": "G001",
  "goal_type": "data_processing",
  "description": "Build DB from CSV",
  "subgoals": [
    {"step": "Load File", "agent": "FileLoader", "status": "pending"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. **Execution Model**

* Master agent selects subgoal
* Selects best-fit agent/tool using LLM
* Executes and logs reasoning ‚Üí status updated
* Repeat until all subgoals complete

Each step includes:

* agent/tool used
* output summary
* reasoning trace

---

## üîß Agent/Tool/Task Design

### Agents (by category)

* `LoaderAgent`
* `SchemaAnalyzerAgent`
* `QueryClassifierAgent`
* `SQLGeneratorAgent`
* `SummarizerAgent`

### Tools

* SQLite wrapper, Pandas Profiler, Faker, Prompt templates, Schema mappers

### Tasks

* `LoadCSV`, `MatchXSDToData`, `GenerateSQL`, `SummarizeTable`

Agents wrap tool + task logic; LLM only selects **agent & task**, not internal tool logic.

## üìä Explainability Layer

| Element       | Format                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Goal Summary  | Name, type, agent path        |
| Reasoning     | Natural language log per step |
| Outputs       | JSON summary of step outputs  |
| Timeline View | Optional per-step timestamps  |

All grouped by `goal_id`, no cross-goal co-mingling.

## üîÅ Repeatable Workflows

| Template Goal         | Subgoal Steps                                               |

# Refined System Architecture for Demo AI Application

## Architecture Layers

* **UI/Monitoring Layer:** A minimal dashboard (web or CLI) for viewing progress. It lists active goals and their status, but does not alter execution. This layer queries the in-memory state to display goal summaries, subgoal logs, and reasoning traces.
* **Orchestration Layer (Master Agents):** Contains one Master Agent per workflow (Data Processing and Query Processing). Each Master Agent is an LLM-driven orchestrator that receives a top-level goal and uses the LLM to plan and dispatch tasks dynamically. This layer holds the core logic for deciding which sub-agents and tools to invoke at each step.
* **Agent/Tool Layer:** Comprises specialized worker agents and tools. Sub-agents perform specific functions (e.g. data ingestion, summarization, classification), while tools are utility functions (e.g. vector embedding, simple computation) that agents can call. Each agent/tool runs in-memory on the data passed to it. Agents do not run on a fixed schedule; the Master Agent instructs them as needed.
* **LLM/Inference Layer:** The large language model(s) themselves, accessed via an API. Master Agents and (if needed) sub-agents use this layer to perform reasoning, plan generation, or complex tasks (like summarization). All prompt-and-response interactions happen here, producing both outputs and chain-of-thought rationales.
* **In-Memory State Layer:** All data, intermediate results, and logs are kept in volatile memory (e.g. in-memory data structures or caches). There is no database or persistent storage. For example, any vector embeddings, datasets, or temporary outputs exist only in RAM. This fits the demo-grade requirement: everything resets on restart.

Each layer communicates through in-memory calls. For example, the UI fetches logs from the GoalTracker (in the Orchestration layer), which itself is updated by agents and tools. This modular layering isolates concerns (UI vs. logic vs. tools) while keeping the entire system in-process.

## Agents, Tools, and Task Design

&#x20;*Figure: Example hierarchical agent architecture with a Master (Project Manager) agent delegating tasks to specialized worker agents.*
The Master Agent acts as a **central coordinator**, dynamically breaking down the top-level goal into sub-tasks and dispatching them to worker agents. This follows a **hierarchical delegation** pattern: the Master Agent (like a project manager) analyzes each goal, asks the LLM for a plan, then assigns parts of that plan to specialized agents. Each *worker agent* focuses on a narrow task (e.g. data cleaning, topic extraction, summary generation). *Tools* are lower-level utilities (e.g. text parsers, embedding generators, simple calculators) that agents can invoke as needed. All agents and tools operate on in-memory data passed by the Master Agent. The architecture remains fully modular and extensible: new agents or tools (for new capabilities) can be added without changing the core design.

* **Master Agent:** The top-level orchestrator. On receiving a goal, it prompts the LLM with the current context and asks ‚ÄúWhat steps should I take to achieve this goal?‚Äù The LLM‚Äôs response (including chain-of-thought) is parsed into subgoals/tasks. The Master Agent then invokes the appropriate worker agents or tools for each subgoal. In effect, the Master Agent acts as a ‚ÄúRouter Agent‚Äù that analyzes each situation and selects the optimal strategy. For example, it might decide ‚ÄúIf data is raw text, call the TextPreprocessor agent; if analysis is needed, call the Analyzer agent,‚Äù based on LLM reasoning.
* **Worker/Sub-Agents:** Specialized agents for functions such as **Data Ingestion**, **Text Splitting**, **Summarization**, **Analysis**, etc. For instance, a DataIngestionAgent might load and partition input data, while a SentimentAgent might run an LLM prompt to classify sentiment. Each agent logs its results and returns outputs to the Master Agent. Agents communicate via function calls and return values; there is no message queue or external service. Agents may also internally call the LLM if their task requires complex reasoning.
* **Tools:** Lightweight utilities (often stateless functions) that perform basic operations on text or data. Examples include an embedding generator, a similarity search function over in-memory vectors, or arithmetic/logical computations. Agents can call these tools when the LLM instructs them to (the LLM might output an ‚Äúaction‚Äù that specifies using a particular tool).
* **Tasks:** Individual actions or operations defined by agents. Each task has a small scope (e.g. ‚Äúclean this batch of text‚Äù, ‚Äúsummarize this paragraph‚Äù, ‚Äúaggregate these numbers‚Äù). The Master Agent dynamically creates tasks based on LLM output. Because there is no fixed DAG, the exact tasks and their order are not hardcoded: at each step, the Master Agent re-queries the LLM to decide the next tasks. In other words, the system behaves as an agentic workflow: **‚Äúworkflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs *dynamically* direct their own processes and tool usage‚Äù**. Our design follows the latter, with the LLM controlling which agents/tools to run in real time.

This agent-based design enables **dynamic planning**: at runtime, the Master Agent continually re-plans based on new information. For example, if the data contains an unexpected format, the LLM might insert an extra subgoal (‚Äúconvert format to JSON‚Äù) on the fly. There is no pre-built FSM or static pipeline ‚Äî all decisions are made by the LLM in context.

## GoalTracker Component

The **GoalTracker** is an in-memory logging and state module that records the lifecycle of each goal. For every new goal, the GoalTracker assigns a unique ID and initializes a record. It then logs *all* subgoals, tasks, agent calls, and decisions as they occur. Key tracked fields include:

* **Goal Metadata:** Goal ID, description, creation timestamp, and current status (pending, in-progress, complete, or failed).
* **Subgoals and Tasks:** A tree or list of subgoals spawned by the Master Agent. Each subgoal record notes which agent/tool executed it, input parameters, and output results.
* **Decision Logs:** For every decision point, the system logs the Master Agent‚Äôs prompt, the LLM‚Äôs response (including chain-of-thought or plan), and the action taken. This captures the *reasoning* behind each branch.
* **Status & Results:** The outcome of each task (success/failure, any errors) and a brief result or summary. Final goal completion or summary is also logged.
* **Human Interventions:** If a step triggers a human-in-the-loop review, the GoalTracker logs when and why this happened, and any user feedback that was inserted.

Without such observability, a multi-agent system is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù where it‚Äôs hard to tell why an agent took a certain turn. Indeed, experts recommend logging *‚Äúhigh-level behavioral traces (agents‚Äô decisions, reasoning steps, tool usage)‚Äù* to gain clarity. Our GoalTracker implements exactly this: it provides a chronological trace of everything each agent decided and did.

The GoalTracker runs entirely in memory. It can be a set of Python objects or data structures (e.g. dictionaries or trees) that get updated by the Master and worker agents. Because the system is demo-grade, all tracking data is ephemeral: when the program stops, the logs disappear. This simplifies the design and keeps everything fast and contained in RAM.

## Execution Control Flow

The control flow is driven by the Master Agent‚Äôs iterative loop, powered by the LLM. A typical sequence is:

1. **Goal Reception:** A new goal arrives (e.g. ‚ÄúProcess dataset X‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnswer query Y‚Äù). The Master Agent creates a GoalTracker entry and updates status to *in progress*.
2. **Planning (LLM Reasoning):** The Master Agent formulates a prompt including the goal and any current context (data, previous outputs). It asks the LLM to propose next steps (subgoals/tasks). For example: *‚ÄúGiven this dataset, what steps are needed to achieve the goal? Please output a list of tasks with brief reasoning.‚Äù* The LLM replies with a plan (often accompanied by chain-of-thought). This plan is logged.&#x20;
3. **Task Execution:** The Master Agent parses the LLM‚Äôs plan into actionable tasks. For each task, it calls the designated agent or tool. For example, if the plan says ‚ÄúSummarize each document,‚Äù the Master Agent loops over documents, invoking the Summarizer agent on each. After each subtask finishes, the agent reports back a result; the Master Agent updates the state and GoalTracker. Tools (like vector searches) may also be invoked here. Each action and its output is logged.
4. **Iteration & Checking:** Once the proposed tasks are done, the Master Agent checks if the original goal is satisfied (possibly by asking the LLM to verify or by checking key outputs). If not, the loop repeats: the Master Agent again prompts the LLM with the updated context and remaining goals. This dynamic loop continues, letting the LLM decide new subgoals each time. There is no fixed number of steps.
5. **Human-in-the-Loop (when needed):** At any decision point, if the LLM‚Äôs response indicates low confidence or ambiguity, the Master Agent can pause for human review. For example, if the LLM says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure which format to use,‚Äù the system flags this situation. The UI can then display this prompt to a human operator for clarification. Per layered chain-of-thought principles, we allow the user to inject feedback or corrections before proceeding. Once resolved, the Master Agent incorporates this new information and continues.
6. **Completion:** When the LLM and agents determine the goal is achieved, the Master Agent marks the goal as complete. A final summary (often generated by an LLM prompt) is recorded in the GoalTracker. The UI can then display the full execution summary for that goal.

Crucially, at **no point** is there a hardcoded DAG or finite-state machine. The Master Agent **always** consults the LLM for the next action, making the flow fully adaptive. All steps and branches are recorded by the GoalTracker for traceability.

## Explainability Model

Explainability is built into every layer of the system: the LLM is prompted to articulate its reasoning, and the system logs these explanations. Key aspects include:

* **Chain-of-Thought Logging:** We prompt the LLM to include intermediate reasoning or justifications in its outputs. This ‚Äúchain-of-thought‚Äù approach has been shown to improve accuracy by breaking problems into steps. Each such reasoning string is captured by the GoalTracker. For example, the LLM might output: *‚ÄúStep 1: break data into chunks because it‚Äôs large; Step 2: analyze each chunk for sentiment; ‚Ä¶‚Äù*. These rationales make the decision process transparent.
* **Layered Reasoning Checks:** Inspired by layered CoT, we treat each planning iteration as a layer that can be verified. The system can (optionally) re-prompt or use additional tool calls to verify intermediate conclusions. For instance, after the LLM plans a step, we might check a facts database or ask the LLM to confirm the plan‚Äôs feasibility. If something seems off, the Master Agent can ask the LLM to revise or flag it for human review. This is akin to **user-injected feedback** at each layer.
* **Structured Logging:** All reasoning is organized by goal and subgoal. The UI will group logs under their parent goal for easy navigation. Each log entry includes: the LLM prompt, the LLM‚Äôs answer (with explanation), which agent ran, and what result was obtained. This satisfies traceability: one can see exactly *why* each decision was made and what the outcome was. As one observability guide notes, monitoring ‚Äúagents‚Äô decisions, reasoning steps, \[and] tool usage‚Äù is crucial for clarity. Our GoalTracker ensures this level of detail.
* **Completion Summaries:** Upon finishing a goal, we generate (or prompt the LLM to generate) a concise summary of what was done and why. This summary, along with the step-by-step log, is displayed in the UI. Users (or developers) can read this summary to quickly understand the high-level outcome.
* **Confidence Signals:** The system may also track confidence indicators. If the LLM has a way to express uncertainty (e.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not certain‚Äù), or if an external confidence check fails, these are logged and can trigger human-in-the-loop intervention. This ensures that unclear or risky reasoning is caught early.

Together, these explainability mechanisms turn the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù decisions into a documented chain of rationale. Every goal‚Äôs record can be replayed or reviewed, and the entire decision tree (with rationale) is visible.

## Monitoring UI Structure

The user interface is a read-only **monitoring dashboard**. It organizes information by goal and is minimalist in design. Key UI components include:

* **Goal List:** A table or list of all goals (both data-processing and query-processing) with columns like Goal ID, Type, Status (e.g. ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù, ‚ÄúWaiting for Human‚Äù), and start time. Clicking a goal expands its details.
* **Goal Detail View:** For a selected goal, a nested outline or card view shows all subgoals/tasks in the order they were executed. Each subgoal entry includes the responsible agent/tool name, a short description, and its status/result. Entries can be expanded to show the full LLM reasoning prompt and response for that step (i.e. the chain-of-thought text).
* **Log/Timeline Pane:** A chronological log view that includes timestamps, actions taken, and outcomes. This might appear alongside the detail view. For readability, log entries are grouped by subgoal. Users can see the sequence: ‚ÄúMaster Agent asked X; LLM answered Y; DataAgent processed chunk; etc.‚Äù
* **Status Indicators:** Color-coded icons or labels indicate success, in-progress, or error for each task. If a task is awaiting human input, the UI highlights it (e.g. with a warning icon).
* **Human Feedback Panel:** Although the UI is not for general interaction, it does allow a human operator to input clarifications when prompted. For example, if the LLM requests clarification, the UI can pop up a dialog asking the user. The user‚Äôs input is then sent back into the GoalTracker and the control flow. (This is only used on ambiguous steps.)
* **Summary Section:** Upon completion of a goal, the UI shows a final summary generated by the system. This may include key results (e.g. summary text, answer to user query) and a confirmation that the goal is done.

The UI pulls all data from the in-memory GoalTracker. It does not persist any state; it simply reflects the current logs. The layout prioritizes clarity: goals are easily selected, and their internal reasoning can be expanded or collapsed. The entire progress view is updated in real time (or near-real time) as the agents work.

## Example Repeatable Workflows

* **Data Processing Workflow:** *Goal:* ‚ÄúProcess incoming customer reviews dataset.‚Äù

  1. The Master Agent receives the dataset and goal. It prompts the LLM: ‚ÄúWhat steps are needed to process these reviews for insights?‚Äù
  2. The LLM responds with a plan (e.g. split into batches, clean text, analyze sentiment, extract key topics, summarize findings) along with reasoning.
  3. The Master Agent spawns a **Data Ingestion Agent** to chunk the data (as advised), then a **TextCleaning Agent** to remove noise. Next, it calls a **Sentiment Agent** (LLM-based) on each chunk, logging each sentiment score. It then invokes a **TopicAgent** to identify common themes, and a **SummaryAgent** to generate an overview report.
  4. Suppose the LLM‚Äôs plan had an unclear step (‚ÄúIdentify anomalies‚Äù), and it outputs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not certain which patterns are anomalies.‚Äù The Master Agent detects this low-confidence signal and pauses, asking the human via the UI to clarify ‚ÄúWhich patterns should count as anomalies?‚Äù The user answers, and the Master continues with the refined instruction.
  5. All along, the GoalTracker logs: the LLM‚Äôs reasoning (‚ÄúWe split data because it‚Äôs large‚Ä¶‚Äù, etc.), each agent‚Äôs actions, and intermediate outputs. Once complete, the system logs ‚ÄúDataset processed; summary generated‚Äù and marks the goal done.
     This workflow is repeatable on any new dataset: the LLM may adjust the plan dynamically (perhaps adding or removing steps if data size or content changes). The trace (splitting strategy, any human clarifications, final report) is fully visible in the UI for each run.

* **Query Processing Workflow:** *Goal:* ‚ÄúAnswer user‚Äôs question using the processed data.‚Äù

  1. A user query is submitted (e.g. ‚ÄúWhat are the top concerns mentioned in recent reviews?‚Äù). The Master Agent creates a goal and asks the LLM to interpret it: ‚ÄúWhat subtasks are needed to answer this query?‚Äù
  2. The LLM might respond: ‚ÄúFind all mentions of concerns in data ‚Üí extract common keywords ‚Üí formulate answer.‚Äù The Master Agent then invokes a **Retrieval Agent** (scanning in-memory text or vectors for relevant snippets) and an **AnswerAgent** (which uses LLM to craft a coherent answer).
  3. During retrieval, if the LLM is unsure which keyword matches a concern, it might say ‚ÄúNot sure if ‚Äòdelay‚Äô refers to shipping or service.‚Äù This triggers a human check. Otherwise, the agents gather the info.
  4. Finally, the **AnswerAgent** outputs a written answer. The Master Agent logs the entire exchange: it will show that the LLM reasoning included chain-of-thought about synonyms and keywords, the data retrieved, and how the answer was composed.
  5. The UI displays the final answer and the reasoning steps that led to it, grouped under that query‚Äôs goal.

Both examples illustrate how the workflows are *repeatable* (they can be run again on new inputs) and *dynamic* (the LLM can alter the plan based on content). Each goal‚Äôs log is kept separate, so the UI can show ‚ÄúGoal 123: ProcessReviews\_2025-06-01‚Äù with its own sub-log, and ‚ÄúGoal 124: AnswerQuery #987‚Äù with a different log.

## Extensibility and Clean Design

This architecture is inherently modular and extendable. Adding a new capability (e.g. a **Translation Agent** or a specialized **Knowledge Agent**) only requires writing that agent or tool and allowing the Master Agent‚Äôs prompts to include it. Because the Master Agent uses LLM reasoning to choose tasks, new agents can be integrated without changing existing code paths. The memory-only design keeps the system simple and self-contained. Performance and scale are not the focus ‚Äî clarity and flexibility are.

In summary, the system uses a layered agent architecture driven entirely by LLM decision-making. Goals and subgoals are tracked end-to-end, reasoning is logged for transparency, and a simple UI allows observers to trace how each goal was achieved. This meets all constraints: in-memory operation, no hardcoded workflow, dynamic LLM-based control, and full explainability.
